A C compiler defines an integer type  of number (int) this way: 
- An integer is a whole number — no fractions or decimal parts. 
- On modern computers, integer values range from –2147483647 through 2147483647
- On older, 16-bit computers, an integer ranges in value from –32768
  through 32767
- An unsigned integer can have a value that ranges from 0 to 32767.
- Negative numbers, from –32768 up to 0 are also allowed. 
- Some compilers may define the range for an int to be much larger than –32768 through 32767. 
  To be certain, check with your compiler’s documentation or help system.
