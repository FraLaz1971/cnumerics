=== ELLIPSE MATHEMATICS LESSON ===

1. DEFINITION:
   An ellipse is the set of all points where the sum of distances
   to two fixed points (foci) is constant.

2. STANDARD EQUATION (center at origin, aligned with axes):
   x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1
   where a = semi-major axis, b = semi-minor axis (a >= b > 0)

3. PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS:
   x = a·cos(t), y = b·sin(t) where t in [0, 2pi]

4. ECCENTRICITY:
   e = sqrt(1 - b^2/a^2) where 0 <= e < 1
   e = 0: circle, e → 1: highly elongated ellipse

5. FOCI:
   Located at (±c, 0) where c^2 = a^2 - b^2
   Distance between foci = 2c

6. AREA: A = pi*a*b

7. PERIMETER (approximation):
   P ~= pi[3(a+b) - sqrt((3a+b)(a+3b))] (Ramanujan's formula)

8. TRANSLATION:
   Center at (h,k): (x-h)^2/a^2 + (y-k)^2/b^2 = 1

9. ROTATION:
   Rotate coordinate system by angle theta using rotation matrix

=== Example 1: Basic Ellipse Properties ===
Center: (0.00, 0.00)
Semi-major axis (a): 5.00
Semi-minor axis (b): 3.00
Major axis length: 10.00
Minor axis length: 6.00
Area: 47.12
Perimeter (approx): 25.53
Eccentricity: 0.8000
Foci: (-4.00, 0.00) and (4.00, 0.00)
Focal distance: 8.00

=== Example 2: Translated and Rotated Ellipse ===
Center: (2.00, 1.00)
Semi-axes: a=4.00, b=2.00
Rotation: 30.00°
Area: 25.13
Eccentricity: 0.8660
Foci: (-1.00, -0.73) and (5.00, 2.73)

=== Example 3: Circle (Special Case of Ellipse) ===
When a = b = 4.00, we get a circle
Eccentricity: 0.0000 (0 = perfect circle)
Area: 50.27 (pi*r^2)
Perimeter: 25.13 (2pi*r)
